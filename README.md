# QJson
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It can represents integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of value, and a collection of name/value pairs.

QJson is a qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects.
JSON arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances, while JSON's objects will be mapped to QVariantMap.

# Install

QJson requires:
  - Qt 4.5 or greater
  - cmake 2.6 or greater

Some possible cmake options:
  - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG`: enables some debug output (other than making
     easier to debug the code)
  - `-DQJSON_BUILD_TESTS=yes` or `-DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS=yes`: builds the unit tests
  - `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/testinstall`: install qjson in a custom directory
  - `-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=${HOME}/testinstall/include`: include a custom include directory
  - `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/testinstall/lib`: include a custom library directory
  - `-DLIB_DESTINATION=lib64`: if you have a 64 bit system with separate
     libraries for 64 bit libraries
  - `-DQJSON_VERBOSE_DEBUG_OUTPUT:BOOL=ON`: more debugging statements are
     generated by the parser. It's useful only if you are trying to fix
     the bison grammar.

For Unix/Linux/Mac:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_preferred_path_ ..
    make
    make install
    /sbin/ldconfig #if necessary

# Contribute

The recommended way to submit your changes is via a pull request.

Before submitting a patch please ensure:

  * Patched code compiles.
  * The patch is fixing a specific issue or implementing a new feature
    (itâ€™s not doing multiple things at the same time).
  * QJson unit tests have been updated.
  * QJson unit tests are passing.

## Unit testing

QJson unit tests are located under the `tests` directory. You can enable them
passing the `-DQJSON_BUILD_TESTS=yes` option to `cmake`.

> Note well: make sure you followed the build instructions.


To run all the unit tests move into the build directory and type:

```
make tests
```

If you want to run the `QJson::Parser` unit tests just type:

```
./test/parser/testparser
```

If you want to run the `QJson::Serializer` unit tests just type:

```
./test/serializer/testserializer
```

If you want to run the `QJson::QObjectHelper` tests just type:

```
./tests/qobjecthelper/testqobjecthelper
```

If you want to test the QJson parser against a specific JSON object you can
use the `cmdline_tester` program.

This binary is located under the `tests` directory and has a
straightforward syntax:

```
./tests/cmdline_tester/cmdline_tester text_file_containing_json_object
```

The command will convert the JSON object to a `QVariant` and dump it to stdout.
More options are available via cli options, just checkout the `--help` output.


**Note well:** cmdline_tester relies on `qDebug()` to dump the object. `qDebug`
has some limitations, like being unable to print utf8 chars.
